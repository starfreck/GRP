# üöÄ GRP (Go Reverse Proxy) üîÑ

GRP is a lightweight and efficient reverse proxy written in Go. It's designed with a unique feature to bypass the [testcookie-nginx-module](https://github.com/kyprizel/testcookie-nginx-module), making it a versatile tool for various web environments.

### üõ†Ô∏è Environment Configuration

Configure the following options in your `.env` file at the root of your project:

```env
NAME=BOSE                                     # Proxy server nickname (use as metadata)
PROXY_SERVER=proxy.server.com                 # The URL of the proxy server
SSL=true                                      # If the proxy server is using SSL certificate
PORT=8080                                     # The port on which the proxy server will run

API_KEY=H3mYLxIUiswMEx5QHnOIVnVeewKuGZpf      # If the target server has some kind of authentication

# Target server(s) configurations
TARGET_URL_1=first.server.com                 # The URL of the upstream server
TEST_COOKIE_1=true                            # If the target server is using testcookie-nginx-module
SSL_1=true                                    # If the target server is using SSL certificate

TARGET_URL_2=second.server.com
TEST_COOKIE_2=true
SSL_2=true

    .
    .
    . 

TARGET_URL_N=nth.server.com
TEST_COOKIE_N=true
SSL_N=true
```
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note 
When adding URLs, please omit the protocols (i.e., do not use http://example.com or https://example.com, but simply use example.com). The protocol will be automatically added based on the values of the SSL variables. If you do not specify SSL variables for a particular target server, the default value will be ‚Äòfalse‚Äô.
